The things I have to get right ALWAYS : 

**Focus** 
& 
**Exposure**

For Exposure, I need to learn and use the three (Ap, Shutter Speed, ISO) to the fullest.

Camera Settings

What lens? What DOF? What type of light?

Timing?
Morning or Evening.

Depends on what type of work I am doing. Eg. Potrait.

# Camera

Type, Sensor, How viewing system works. 

DSLR, Point and Shoot

Mirrorless.

EVF.

2.4m is baseline.

> What is EVF Magnification?

I am not clear.

> What is Parallax ?

With a lens-shutter camera, parallax is the difference between what the viewfinder sees and what the camera records, especially at close distances. This is caused by the separation between the viewfinder and the picture-taking lens.

# Shutter Speed

Shutter speed is the time between the two shutters.
Better way to understand "Exposure time" `how much time it is exposed to the light`
