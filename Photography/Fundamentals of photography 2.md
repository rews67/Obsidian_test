Handholding test, see where is the limitations are for me.
Need to know my limit.

# Shutter speed

## Fast Shutter speeds 8000 - 250

why blurry?
distance

>Water are good for fast movements and slow motions.

### Two critical shutter speeds

#### 500

It freezes human movement. context dependent.

#### 60

### What's the appropriate shutter speed?
when it is good enough, extra freezing doesn't do me any good.


### Is blur totally bad
Blur is used for motion/ that's how we understand motion
>A little bit of blur is alright to show motion

### 250 is the limit for faster moving objects

## 125-60 Mid range

### 125 is good for things that are moving around but not too fast.

### 60 

is the 2nd critical shutter speed; good for stopping casual human action.

## Slower shutter speeds

### 30

blurry motion for the cab

![[Pasted image 20220310232303.png]]
I can go in 30 when people are small

blur adds to the photo.
